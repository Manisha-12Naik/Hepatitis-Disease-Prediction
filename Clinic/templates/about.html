    <p><font color="white">Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. It may be caused by viral infection, alcohol consumption, several health conditions, or even some medications. Treatment varies based on the type and underlying cause.</font></p>
    <br>
    <p><font color="white">Hepatitis refers to an inflammatory condition of the liver. It is commonly the result of a viral infection, but there are other possible causes of hepatitis.

        These include autoimmune hepatitis and hepatitis that occurs as a secondary result of medications, drugs, toxins, and alcohol. Autoimmune hepatitis is a disease that occurs when your body makes antibodies against your liver tissue.
        
        The five main viral classifications of hepatitis are hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. A different virus is responsible for each type of viral hepatitis.
        
        The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 354 millionTrusted Source people currently live with chronic hepatitis B and C globally.</font></p>

        <p><b><font color="white">Hepatitis A
            Hepatitis A is the result of an infection with the hepatitis A virus (HAV). This type of hepatitis is an acute, short-term disease.
            
            Hepatitis B
            The hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes hepatitis B. This is often an ongoing, chronic condition. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that around 826,000Trusted Source people are living with chronic hepatitis B in the United States and around 257 million people worldwide.
            
            
            Hepatitis C
            Hepatitis C comes from the hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV is among the most common bloodborne viral infections in the United States and typically presents as a long-term condition.
            
            According to the CDC, approximately 2.4 million AmericansTrusted Source are currently living with a chronic form of this infection.
            
            
            Hepatitis D
            This is a rare form of hepatitis that only occurs in conjunction with hepatitis B infection. The hepatitis D virus (HDV) causes liver inflammation like other strains, but a person cannot contract HDV without an existing hepatitis B infection.
            
            Globally, HDV affects almost 5 percentTrusted Source of people with chronic hepatitis B.
            
            Hepatitis E
            Hepatitis E is a waterborne disease that results from exposure to the hepatitis E virus (HEV). Hepatitis E is mainly found in areas with poor sanitation and typically results from ingesting fecal matter that contaminates the water supply.
            
            This disease is uncommonTrusted Source in the United States, according to the CDC.
            
            Hepatitis E is usually acute but can be particularly dangerous in pregnant women.</font></b></p>
